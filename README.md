## 🌌 Who Am I?

I'm not your average developer. I'm a **cosmic hacker**—a digital explorer who thrives on bending the rules of reality with code.

- 🧠 Self-taught, self-driven, and always learning
- 💻 Passionate about cybersecurity, automation, and AI
- 🛠️ I break things to understand them—and build them back better
- 🌐 I believe the internet is our playground, and knowledge should be free

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

This repo is my **digital fingerprint**—a living, breathing space where I experiment, iterate, and evolve. Expect:

- ⚙️ Scripts, exploits, and automation tools
- 🧪 Experimental projects and proof-of-concepts
- 🧠 Notes, ideas, and raw thoughts from the edge of innovation

## 🧬 Philosophy

> “Hack the planet” isn’t just a phrase—it’s a mindset.

I believe in:
- **Open source as a weapon** for empowerment
- **Curiosity as a compass** for growth
- **Code as a canvas** for expression
